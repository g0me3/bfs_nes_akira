WHATS NEW

	CODE CHANGES (you won't see it during gameplay mostly)
	
- as usual, movable disasm (there is an issue with current macroses, so you couldn't just move the script blocks around as you wish, but you may try to find some positions, where they do assemble for sure), all trash removed (a LOT of unused lib calls, data copy, etc.), removed all unused code, all redundant code refactored, reduced call tables sizes, reduced a number of non-zero page vars, reducing size of code as well a lot, most of far calls are automatically decide if they far or near (for those who is using it).
- total macrofication of the code, a lot of things are easier to see and code now.
- most of direct data arguments converted to stack-passing arguments, reduced size of code much than 1.5 times.
- text output system also macroficated, readable and easy editable and completely movable to any place now, english (dank trans) and russian (scarabay) scripts added, selectable by macro constant (english script additionally optimized with additional dictionary entries to fit into 32K of data, but since we have 16K banks of the free space, I did it just for fun, russian script uses one of spare banks).
- texts are reorganized, moved a lot of messages from block 17 to its own blocks. only messages used from more than one place are left there.
- also reoptimized menu library for english script.
- palette data size reduced.
- game interactive state machine indexified, all direct indexes converted to labeled mnemonics, fully movable and replaceable. all index recalc now done automatic.

	GAME CHANGES (fixed bugs or changed game behaviour)

- fixed wrong scrolls, attributes damage, sprites disappearance in demo sequence, however there are some issues still left.
- swapped mouth animation phases for most of scenes. most of the time the game has a swapped mouth animation phases, so all chars are staying with the open mouths by default. in some places this has point, but seems the original developers has no much time to fix it separately for every scene.
