		oes he think
		he's fooling?

		I got on Yamagata's bike to
		chase Tetsuo.

		First, we checked our hangout.

		Owner: Oh, you scared me.
		What do you guys want?

		Owner: That was fast!
		Did you find Tetsuo?

		Owner: Hey! Wait!

		Kaneda: No way!

		We reached sector  [num].

		We tried to find Tetsuo's
		location.

		Man: Oh, Tetsuo? He went
		toward sector 2.

		Man: You jerks are way too
		loud!

		Man: Tetsuo? No idea.

		Man: Tetsuo? He just went
		toward sector 3.

		Man: What's your rush?

		Man: Tetsuo, huh? I think he
		went toward sector 4.

		Man: Go away!
		...Unless you got some pills!

		Man: T-thanks. Y-you're
		searchin' for someone?

		Water's running through the
		channel.

		It's NeoTokyo's slum. There's
		a noodle shop and a dorm.

		It's the outskirts of Neo
		Tokyo. There are lots of
		factories nearby.

		Kaneda: You wouldn't be so
		jumpy if you didn't have
		something to hide.
		Why don't you sell normal
		drinks for a change?

		Owner: How 'bout buying
		something for once! This
		isn't a damn hangout!

		Yamagata: Yeah right! Drink
		your dog piss?

		That bastard is hiding pills.


		Owner: If you're looking
		for pills, I don't have any.


		Owner: I think Tetsuo headed
		toward sector  [num].

		There's no sign of Tetsuo.

		Man: Show some respect!

		The man struck my face.
		It turned into a brawl.

		Kai: It's the cops!

		Kaneda: Run for it!

		We were caught by the police.

		Kaneda was sent to a reform
		school.

		Man: You're looking for that
		guy? He went toward the
		factories.

		Man: Brought some pills?

		Kaneda: Wait!

		We found Tetsuo outside
		the factories.

		Tetsuo and the girl were
		being attacked by the Clowns!
		I jumped off my bike.

		Kai: Kaneda, watch out!

		Whoosh!

		An iron pipe swung toward
		Kaneda's head.

		Swish!

		The iron pipe cut the air.

		Kai: Are you going to
		leave him?!

		Thud!

		Kai's iron pipe slammed into
		the Clown's head.

		We rescued Tetsuo and
		surrounded the Clowns.

		Tetsuo became furious and
		started beating the Clown
		who hurt the girl.

		Kaneda: You're gonna kill him!
		You want that?

		Tetsuo: I want him more than
		dead! I'll split his fucking
		head open!

		Tetsuo: Shut up!
		Don't order me around!

		Kaneda: We were just worried.

		Tetsuo: I could handle it on
		my own! I admit I've been
		beaten before... But I won't
		always be on the receiving
		end!

		Girl: Tetsuo...

		Tetsuo: Shut up! Go away!

		Kaneda: Hey, wait! Where are
		you going?

		Tetsuo: Leave me alone!

		Tetsuo pushed past us.

		Tetsuo: Agh!

		Tetsuo: AKIRA?!
		I don't know who that is!

		AKIRA!

		Kaneda: Tetsuo...

		Kai: Hey...

		Tetsuo cowered in the corner.

		Suddenly, black cars and a CRC
		approached.

		It looks like an Army car.

		It's the Control Room Car,
		a lab-on-wheels from the looks
		of it.

		As I approached the CRC,
		several men in lab coats
		came out.

		The men surrounded Tetsuo and
		examined him.

		Assistant A: This is really
		strange!

		Assistant B: I'm getting a
		blue pattern on scope No. 3.

		Doctor: What? No! Retrieve the
		subject now! Hurry!

		Looks like they gave Tetsuo
		some sort of injection.

		Seems the men in white from
		the CRC were after Tetsuo's
		body.

		Kaneda: Leave my friend alone!

		Kaneda: Hey! What do you mean
		by "subject"?

		As I ran to him, a man in
		black blocked my path.

		Kaneda: What's with the
		get-up? You going to a
		funeral?


		Kaneda: on's with the
		get-up? You going to a
		
		Kaneda: ing! on do you mean
		by "subject"?

		As I ran to him, a man in
		black blocked my path.

		Kaneda: on's with the
		get-up? You going to a
		funeral?

		?

		ack blocked my path.

		Kaneda: on's with the
		get-up? You going to a
		funeral?

		ck clothes blocked my path.

		Kaneda: on

		eer.
		This one's cold!

		Kaneda: It's those jerks'
		beer, so I'll go for it!
		Bottle opener...
		...There's no opener...
		Wonder if I can knock
		the cap off...

		Kaneda: This looks like a
		good spot to do it!
		Ok now...

		Shpon! Gtang!

		The vent opened!

		Looks like I can get out of
		here.

		Kch Kch

		Kaneda: Hmm, looks like it
		won't open here.

		I crawled into the air duct.

		...I fell asleep.

		It's a case of beer.

		Kaneda: Jeez, there's nothing
		in here.

		Kaneda: It looks cramped.

		Kaneda: I've made it to the
		vent in the next room...

		I hear voices.
		It's Ryu and the Terrorists...

		I can get out this way.

		Water's dripping from the
		ceiling.

		Kei, join me next time!

		Thud!

		Kaneda: Damn!

		Is there a way to hear their
		conversation?

		.

		I pulled myself out of the
		air duct.

		Kaneda: Ow, ow, ow!
		What're you doing that for?

		Kei: Kaneda...

		Kaneda: Wait a sec... Please!
		Listen to what I have to say.

		Kei: He saved my life!

		Kaneda: Twice!

		Ryu: That could've been just
		to spy on us.

		Kaneda: My friend was in that
		incident in the Old Town!
		You probably don't believe
		me, but it's true. I was
		with him!

		Kaneda: Please take me with
		you to the lab.

		Kaneda: It's a little
		embarrassing to ask...

		Ryu: What?!
		You know about that?

		Kei saved me and took me to
		their room. They were having
		some kind of discussion.

		Ryu: Right, you come with us.
		Here's the pass to the lab.

		Knowing Kei, she didn't tell
		them about us.

		Kaneda: That would be about
		Tetsuo.

		The wrinkled kid that night?
		That was from being an
		experiment?
		If Tetsuo's at the lab too,
		then...

		I'm coming, Tetsuo!

		Terrorist: The Army seems to
		be working to protect
		human experimentation.

		Terrorist: We should be able
		to sneak into the lab using
		that pass.

		Terrorist: People don't know
		what their high taxes are
		used for.
		If we found proof they're
		putting it toward these labs...

		Terrorist: You really are
		a spy!

		Kei: How did you even have a
		camera?

		DPThe next day, we snuck into
		the lab through the drainage
		system...

		Kaneda: This stinks!
		Kei: Shh, quiet!

		Kaneda: What? I'm saying it
		stinks, because it does!
		Your smell must be off.

		Terrorist: Up ahead is the
		central wiring system. If
		we're able to block it, we
		should be able to sneak into
		the basement.

		Ryu: Damn! They've spotted us!

		Terrorist: They're F.P.H.s!

		One of the Terrorists was hit!

		Kei: Do it quickly and
		quietly!

		I picked up the dead
		Terrorist's gun.

		But the gun on the F.P.H.
		swiveled toward me.
		Vulcanized bullets drove into
		the mud.

		Kaneda: Huh? It's out of
		ammo!

		Kaneda: Damn!

		I threw the gun away.

		Kaneda: Ugh...
		-cough- -cough-
		I laid in the mud.

		Splash!

		I sprung out of the water and
		climbed onto the wall of the
		sewer.

		Kaneda: It's coming!

		Kaneda: Hyah!

		I leapt toward the F.P.H.

		Kaneda: Wah.
		Kei: Aaah.

		I grabbed the F.P.H., and
		after a lot of struggling,
		I managed to get onto it.

		Kei: Aaah!

		Kaneda: Kei! Over here, get
		on quick!

		Kei: Kaneda!
		They're behind us!

		A Button: Fire
		B Button: Dodge
		Select:   Turn around

		I stole the F.P.H., and
		with Kei on board, fled
		to the lab.

		Kaneda: Great, we finally
		made it.

		Kei: The Army's here!

		Kaneda: Let's blow them out
		of the way!

		Radio: -bz- -gzzt-
		give heavy weapons license
		-bz- Captain.

		Seems I turned on the radio.

		Radio: -bzt-
		that boy must have been a
		patient in the hospital wing
		of the lab.

		Kaneda: Where's Tetsuo?!

		Kei: Quiet!
		Turn up the volume!

		Radio: -gzzt- escaped from his
		cell. Tetsuo Shima.

		Radio: He's headed for the
		Nursery, you -gzt-

		Kaneda: Tetsuo?!

		Radio: -gzt- situation is
		extremely dangerous!
		We must use 'it'!
		Repeat, we must use 'it'!

		Kei: The Nursery is over
		that way.
		Kaneda: Eh?
		Kei: Turn that way!

		Kaneda: Room A?
		Kei: What're you doing,
		that's the Nursery!
		Kaneda: I can't stop!

		Kei: The brakes!
		Don't you understand brakes?!
		Kaneda: I don't have my
		license with me today!

		Kaneda: Where the hell do we
		go from here?
		Kei: Straight ahead...
		That way...
		Kaneda: Er...

		Kiyoko: There's an entry
		elevator. Use it to go down to
		sublevel 8.

		We eventually made it all the
		way to sublevel 8.

		A Button: Fire
		B Button: Dodge

		Kaneda: Outta the way!

		G$01Fwsh! Crunch!
		Kaneda: Owwww.

		We made it into Room A.
		The F.P.H. exploded, and we
		were thrown onto the
		floor.

		Inside were a few wrinkly
		kids, those Army bastards,
		and... Tetsuo.

		The Nursery looked like it'd
		been through an earthquake.

		Kaneda: You think it's MY
		fault?!

		Kaneda: So this is the
		Nursery?

		It's the kid from before!

		The kid's friends?

		Colonel: Get these kids
		out of here now!

		Tetsuo: Kaneda?
		...Why are you here?

		Kaneda: Tetsuo, you ok?
		I came to save you!

		Tetsuo: It's ok, Kaneda.
		You don't need to save me
		anymore. From now on, I'll
		be the one saving you...

		Tetsuo: What're you
		talking about?

		Tetsuo: What're you doing?!
		Kaneda: Ugh... Augh!

		Boom!

		Kaneda fainted...

		Kei: Kaneda...

		Tetsuo: Buried... beneath the
		Olympic Grounds?!

		Kiyoko: No! Akira...
		Wait! Aah!

		Tetsuo destroyed the ceiling
		and flew out, leaving only
		his echoing laughter behind.

		Kiyoko: This is horrible!
		To think he's that strong...

		Colonel: To gain so much power
		in so little time! What could
		this mean...
		Find him!

		Kiyoko: Stop it...
		Don't hurt any more people...
		Tetsuo: Where is Akira?!

		Kei stared at the kids.

		Kaneda: Heh, this is Rat Town.
		We entered it when we were
		going through the drainage
		canals.

		Colonel: How did you get that?!

		Colonel: What're you doing?
		Hurry

		$04$4CNursery

		here now!

		Tetsuo: Kaneda?
		...Why are you here?

		Kaneda: Tetsuo, you ok?
		I came to save you!

		Tetsuo: It's ok, Kaneda.
		You don't need to save me
		anymore. From now on, I'll
		be the one saving you...

		Tetsuo: What're you
		talking about?

		Tetsuo: What're you doing?!
		Kaneda: Ugh... Augh!

		Boom!

		Kaneda fainted...

		Kei: Kaneda...

		Tetsuo: Buried... beneath the
		Olympic Grounds?!

		Kiyoko: No! Akira...
		Wait! Aah!

		Tetsuo destroyed the ceiling
		and flew out, leaving only
		his echoing laughter behind.

		Kiyoko: This is horrible!
		To think he's that strong...

		Colonel: To gain so much power
		in so little time! What could
		this mean...
		Find him!

		Kiyoko: Stop it...
		Don't hurt any more people...
		Tetsuo: Where is Akira?!

		Kei stared at the kids.

		Kaneda: Heh, this is Rat Town.
		We entered it when we were
		going through the drainage
		canals.

		Colonel: How did you get that?!

		Colonel: What're you doing?
		Hurry and capture him!

		Colonel: How did you get

		this far?!

		I tried to talk to him.

		But the kid wouldn't talk.

		But the kid only stared at
		Kei, refusing to answer.

		Kei: You are...

		Kiyoko: That's right.

		Kaneda: Hurry up and do it,
		idiot!

		Kaneda: What? Who's listening
		to you, anyway?

		Tetsuo: Heh... So you don't
		feel like listening...
		Are you mad? So what'll you
		do then, Kaneda?

		he boss all the time.

		Kaneda: Now it looks like
		you've become a boss, too.
		The boss of this pile of
		trash!

		Tetsuo: Kaneda...!

		The laser I fired hit the
		sample case.

		As I fired, I tripped on a
		piece of rubble.

		Kaneda jumped upon Tetsuo,
		but was hit by the
		shock wave...

		Tetsuo: It's not so bad this
		way... Kaneda... Now I
		understand the meaning of
		regret...

		Then, as Tetsuo was getting
		back up, his right arm was
		severed by the beam.

		Bssh!

		Tetsuo suddenly set up a
		barrier.

		Tetsuo jumped up, leaving the
		atmosphere.
		Tetsuo had left to destroy SOL
		itself.

		Kaneda: Got 'im... But he was
		able to put up that barrier,
		so he must still have some
		life in him...

		I fired the laser, but it
		didn't reach Tetsuo...

		Kaneda: Huh? It's dead?!

		Tetsuo: What's wrong,
		Kaneda...?

		Kaneda: Dammit! That's dirty,
		Tetsuo! Let's have a fair
		fight!

		Tetsuo's surroundings began
		to glow, and gradually shone
		brightly.

		Kaneda: Huh...?

		It was the laser beam fired
		from SOL on the orders of
		the Colonel.

		Confused, I began to run away.
		The rubble around me shook
		violently.

		Tetsuo drew up the mountain
		of rubble.

		Kaneda: Whoa, Tetsuo...

		I lifted one of the rocks
		and threw it at Tetsuo.

		Kaneda: Unf!

		Again, the light began to
		gather. Everything in view
		shone a bright white.

		When I opened my eyes, rubble
		was floating in the air.
		Tetsuo had set up a barrier,
		and dispersed the beam.

		Tetsuo: Damn...

		Kaneda: What is it?

		Kaneda: Ow.

		The barrier of rubble had
		fallen.

		Zap! Fssht!
		But before I even noticed,
		the rubble had been destroyed
		by a beam.

		The beam had come incredibly
		close already.

		Kaneda: Save me, Kei!

		Through the sound of the
		explosion, I could hear
		Kai's scream.

		Kei was on Kai's bike and
		they came up in front of me.

		Kaneda: Kai! Kei!

		Kaneda: But where?

		Kei: Come on, quick!

		Kaneda: Ok...

		Kaneda: Hey, watch it! It's
		rocky around here!

		Tetsuo: Die...

		I ducked in between the
		rubble.

		Zap!

		The beam hit Kaneda directly.

		Kaneda: Wonder how far it'll
		come?

		I looked over at the beam to
		figure it out.

		Kaneda: Augh!

		I scream

		Yes... it is what we
		have seen... In order to
		bring Tetsuo...

		Kaneda: Bring him... where?

		Takashi: Tetsuo was beyond
		help...
		Our help...
		and even Akira's...

		Masaru: He was just too big
		for us as we are now.

		Kiyoko: But someday even we...

		Masaru: It's still just
		beginning...

		Kiyoko: Your friend...

		Kaneda: You mean Kei?

		Kei: Kaneda!

		I could hear Kei's voice...

		Kaneda: Kei...

		Masaru: Kiyoko, Takashi.

		Takashi: Masaru, Kiyoko.

		Kiyoko: Takashi, Masaru.

		The shrunken ball of light
		appeared to fade as it flew
		away...

		When I came to, I was on top
		of the pile of rubble in
		the stadium.

		I grasped the fading ball
		of light without thinking.

		Kaneda: Tetsuo...

		Kei: Kaneda...

		Kaneda: Thank you... for
		calling my name.
		I heard you...

		Kei: Tetsuo...
		Kaneda: He's gone... along
		with those three...
		and Akira...

		Kei: Kaneda... earlier, you...

		The clouds were washed away,
		and the sun shone.

		We could only gaze at the
		light...

		Then, we got on the bike and
		headed for NeoTokyo.

		Even the broken buildings
		of NeoTokyo felt a full
		showering of sunlight.

		...Light sprung from the
		white emptiness. Gradually,
		atoms were born. The atoms...

		Grew, and became gaseous
		forms.
		Soon, space appeared...
		and galaxies...

		Planets and stars were born...

		Tetsuo: I am... Tetsuo...

		Kaneda: I wonder... of course!

		Miyako: Cleanse your body!
		Purify it in fire, and
		come back!

		Miyako: Oh, you say you want
		to stop?

		A Button: Yes!
		B Button: No!

		Miyako: Akira's awakening
		is nigh! He has need of your
		strength! Take heart and
		join in!

		Miyako: Fool! That's not it!
		Try inputting it again!

		Kaneda: My password is



		Miyako: Oh, good, you came
		back! Enter your password now!

		They were all in the Old Town,
		staring at the expanding
		bright light.

		NeoTokyo was moving more
		and more towards the worst
		of everything.

		But it was Kaneda that
		finally awoke Akira.

		Kaneda: -cough-
		Blech.

		Army: Shut up!

		Army: Hey! No snooping!

		Kaneda: Stop it!

		Kaneda: Uh, what do I do...

		Kaneda met an untimely end...

		Kaneda: ...

		This is Game Over!
		Please try again!
		A Button: Let's try!
		B Button: I'm done!

		Kaneda: Whoa!

		Kaneda: Tetsuo, what did
		you do?!

		Tetsuo: Ugh... -huff-

		Army: Hey, that's as far as
		you go!

		The Army goon fired his gun!

		Kaneda was caught by the
		Army and sent to juvie.

		Kaneda: Hey now...

		Terrorist: What'd you say?!

		Kaneda: Ah! What's this?

		Kaneda: Ugh! -glub-

		Kei: Idiot!

		Kaneda: Uugh!

		Kei: Ah!

		Tetsuo: Haha...

		Tetsuo: Agh... Ah!

		The door requires a key.

		Kai: Kaneda...

		Kaneda: Bastards!

		I looked into the river
		below...

		I readied the aim on my laser.

		The laser hit Tetsuo's chest!

		Tetsuo: Ugh...

		Kaneda: I did it, Yamagata!

		Tetsuo died...

		Through Kaneda's work, Akira's
		resurrection was prevented.
		NeoTokyo became peaceful
		once more...

		Tetsuo: Kaneda?!

		Tetsuo's hair is standing on
		end.

		Tetsuo's planning to unleash
		a shock wave!

		The laser missed!

		Kaneda: Huh?
		It won't work!

		Kaneda: Now at maximum....
		Um...

		Kaneda: M-mommy, save me!

		Thud!

		Man: ...

		There isn't time for that!

		Terrorist: We're gonna sneak
		into the lab?! Are you crazy?
		And with this kid from
		before...

		Terrorist: This is a pass
		that'll get us into the lab
		for a week...

		Terrorist: New experimental
		subject?

		Ryu: The boy who caused all of
		that commotion in the Old
		Town was taken into custody in
		the lab...

		Ryu: It looks like it's a
		training center, but it's
		really a human experimentation
		lab...

		Kaneda: Tetsuo!

		The laser hit Tetsuo's right
		arm!

		AKIRA!!!

		Bang!

		The Terrorist fired his gun.

		Ryu: That's right.
		Last week, our forces
		liberated experimental
		subject "No. 26" during
		the night.

		Ryu: It's an urgent order, and
		we're already making plans.

		Kei: From Mr. Nezu, right?
		What's the objective?

		Ryu: Here's some data about
		the new experimental subject.

		Owner: Tetsuo headed toward
		Sector num.

		Kai: We're wasting time!

		Kaneda: Sorry. Can I
		have these pills?

		We somehow managed to avoid
		the Army guys. And, with her
		guidance, we came to this
		place.

		Miyako: Your password is
		password

		Now, remember it well!

		That night, we were chasing
		the Clowns along the highways
		of the Old Town.

		The next day, we were brought
		in for an Army investigation.

		Student: Huh?

		That night, we were on the
		rooftop garden in front of
		the fountain. Our friends
		were chatting idly.

		What was that wrinkled kid
		from that night, anyway?

		Surely Tetsuo has no
		relationship with that kid,
		right? Where the hell did
		those Army guys take Tetsuo?

		Kai: Oh, what're you thinkin'
		about?

		Groupie: This is, like,
		boring!

		Yamagata: Shut up!

		Groupie: Fine... idiot!

		 $BFThe light covered the rubble,
		and spread out.

		Tetsuo: This light... what is
		it?!

		In an instant, the area in
		front of me became a bright
		white.

		 TerroristThe sample case hit with a
		laser let off energy. This
		energy resonated with Tetsuo's
		power, and Akira was reborn
		into the world.

		Akira's light grew more and
		more, consuming both Akira
		and Kaneda.

		Tetsuo: Agh, Akira...

		NeoTokyo returned to silence.

		Tetsuo: Ah!

		Only Tetsuo's face remained
		human, as the rest turned
		into a fleshy blob.

		Tetsuo: Grah!

		The fleshy blob let
		out a scream.

		Tetsuo: Kaneda, run!

		Kaneda: Shit...

		Tetsuo: Gah!

		At one end of the stadium the
		blob was filling, Kiyoko,
		Masaru, and Takashi were
		sitting. In front of them,
		there was a sample case.

		It filled the entire stadium
		with a calming light.

		Soon, as the light was
		reaching the buildings,
		the destruction of the Old
		Town began.

		The light became a giant
		sphere. Most of the Old Town
		had been covered...

		With the laser's energy, the
		expanding Tetsuo extended to
		envelop the 3 of them and
		even Akira's sample case.

		Kiyoko: Tetsuo... Ah!

		Takashi: It's no use!

		Masaru: Agh! Akira...

		After destroying the stadium,
		Tetsuo expanded and consumed
		the entirety of the Old Town.

		With the collapse of the Old
		Town, the ocean itself poured
		into NeoTokyo.

		NeoTokyo returned to silence.
		Having destroyed the Old Town,
		Tetsuo was crying.

		The kids teleported me out of
		the stadium.

		When we made it back to the
		crumbling stadium, we met
		Kei and Kai.

		But, how did the two
		powers resonate...?

		Akira and Tetsuo regenerated
		inside the rubble.

		Tetsuo: I've found you at
		last, Akira...

		With the destruction of Neo
		Tokyo, the new story of Akira
		had begun...
		In the Greater Tokyo Empire...

		Kaneda struggled, but he was
		consumed by the light.

		...Kaneda was taken into
		Akira, and his very being
		annihilated.

		NeoTokyo returned to silence.
		It was completely destroyed.

		Kai and Kei were at the
		highway's tollbooth.

		Kai: This is bad... We've
		gotta get outta here!

		Kei: Kaneda!

		The light gave off a groan,
		and began to erode the
		Old Town.

		The buildings were enveloped,
		and trash, billboards, and
		Army tanks alike were absorbed
		and vaporized. The Old Town
		had been mostly destroyed.

		I drifted about in the light.
		...My life began to flash
		before my eyes.

		Kaneda: You see, you're just
		not digging in enough...

		Yamagata: You take the corner
		like you wanna die.
		Here, watch...

		Kai: Whaddaya mean?

		Yamagata: It's cornering.

		Kaneda: Hahaha... Hey,
		Tetsuo...

		Oh look, he's back.

		 Is he a transfer student?

		He was just cast aside...

		 He looks like he's been
		through a lot.

		Kaneda: Are you... dreaming,
		Tetsuo?

		Tetsuo: -sniff-

		Kaneda: The new guys around
		here always get beat up. It
		happened again today. I got
		hit, too... but that other guy
		is really weak.

		Tetsuo: I'm Tetsuo...
		Tetsuo Shima...

		Kaneda: I'm new here too.
		My
